# ToDo

## 2025-08-15
- [ ] Fix: top label gets clipped for p>=0.001
  - [ ] Adjust label staggering. Label height should only be staggered if horizontal distance to previous label is sufficiently small, e.g. the 99% label is too high because it's far enough from the previous label horizontally that it shouldn't be staggered.
- [ ] Plan features
  - [ ] Specialized themes with dropdown menus for specific uses; e.g., Dice:d6/d20, Pokemon:eggs/dynamax
  - [ ] Other distributions?
