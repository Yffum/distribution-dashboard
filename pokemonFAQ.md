### So the more attempts I make, the closer I get?

Nope, you never get closer to getting a shiny with these methods\*. Think of it like rolling a die to get a 6. You'll have a better chance if you roll it multiple times (as the graph shows), but each time you roll, you don't actually get any closer.

\*There are some shiny hunting methods in certain games where the shiny rate can increase based on the number of attempts. For example, in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee there are catch combos that increase the shiny rate. Methods such as this are not represented on this website. The chart assumes that the shiny rate is constant.

### What is an attempt exactly?

An attempt is essentially one shiny roll. If you're breeding, every hatch is an attempt. If you're catching, every spawn you see of the Pokemon you're looking for is an attempt. One exception is Dynamax Adventures, where you don't see if a Pokemon is shiny unless you catch it. In this case, every catch is an attempt.

In Dynamax Adventures, if you're looking for a shiny legendary, then you get one attempt per cave (if you catch the legendary). If you're looking for any shiny, then you get up to four attempts per cave (one attempt for each catch).

In Scarlet and Violet, if you're looking for any shiny, then every newly spawned Pokemon you see\*\* is an attempt. Then you may wonder, what if a Pokemon spawns but you don't see whether it's shiny because it's too far or you ran past it? Those Pokemon do not count as attempts. Think of it like rolling a die repeatedly to see how many rolls it takes to get a 6. If one time you roll the die and then pick it up without seeing the number, you don't know whether you rolled a 6 or not. And whether you did doesn't change your chances for the next roll. So basically, it doesn't count. \*\*So when I say "see" I really mean "see well enough to determine whether it is shiny".

### Why is the average number of attempts unlucky?

Well, I chose to define lucky/unlucky based on the median number of attempts, which is significantly less than the average. You might define luck differently, but I'll explain the reasoning behind my definition.

Let's take Dynamax Adventures with Shiny Charm as an example. The shiny rate is 1/100, so on average you'll find a shiny every 100 attempts. Of course, "on average" is only true if you have a sufficiently large sample size. If you only catch a single shiny, and it takes 200 attempts, then your personal average would simply be 200. You could think of the 100 attempt average as the average for all the shinies ever caught by every player using this method. Now, the median number of attempts is about 69. That means that 50% of all the shinies ever caught with this method took 69 attempts or fewer. So why is the average greater than the median? Well, when you take less than 69 attempts, the farthest you can get from the median is 1 attempt. But if you take more than 69 attempts, there's no limit to how far you can get from the median; it could take a thousand tries or more! This skews the average higher than the median. Another way to look at the median is: if you make 69 attempts, there's a 50% chance that at least one of those attempts succeeded (and a 50% chance that none of those attempts succeeded).

So the way I see it, once you've made enough attempts that there's more than a 50% chance one of your previous attempts was a shiny, but you didn't find a shiny in those previous attempts, that's unlucky. But keep in mind, the unlucky 50% of shinies that people catch take significantly more attempts, which means most attempts will be spent on the unlucky runs.
