# Distribution Dashboard

A simple dashboard for visualizing probability distributions. The goal of this project was simply to gain experience using Javascript sans Node.js.

Currently the dashboard only features a geometric CDF chart with labels at key probabilities to get a general sense of the distribution for a given p value.

I've added a theme selector for framing the distribution in different contexts. The only theme at the moment is Pokemon, which gives a dropdown menu of different techniques for finding shinies (rare Pokemon) based on corresponding p values. More charts or themes may or may not be added in the future.

A FAQ can be found on the website, below the chart. If a theme is selected, a secondary set of questions specific to the theme will appear as well. The main FAQ can also be viewed at `/faq.md`, and theme FAQs can be viewed at `/<theme>FAQ.md`
