- So the more attempts I make, the closer I get?

Nope, you never get closer to getting a shiny with these methods*. Think of it like rolling a die to get the highest number. You'll have a better chance if you roll it multiple times (as the graph shows), but each time you roll, you don't actually get any closer.

*There are some shiny hunting methods in certain games where the shiny rate can increase based on the number of attempts. For example, in Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee there are catch combos that increase the shiny rate. Methods such as this are not represented on this site. Each graph assumes that the shiny rate is constant.

- What is an attempt exactly?

An attempt is essentially one spawn. If you're breeding, every hatch is an attempt. If you're catching, every spawn you see of the Pokemon you're looking for is an attempt. One exception is Dynamax Adventures, where you don't see if a Pokemon is shiny unless you catch it. In this case, every catch is an attempt.

So in Dynamax Adventures, if you're looking for a shiny legendary, then you get one attempt per cave (if you catch the legendary); if you're looking for any shiny then you get up to four attempts per cave (one attempt for each catch).

- Why is the average number of attempts unlucky?

Well, I chose to define lucky/unlucky based on the median number of attempts, which is significantly less than the average. You might define luck differently, but I'll explain the reasoning behind my definition.
